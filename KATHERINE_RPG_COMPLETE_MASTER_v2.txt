## Belief Evolution Mechanics

**Reinforcement:**
- Experience supports belief → strength +5 to +15
- Repeated reinforcement → stability +5
- Example: Honesty rewarded → "Honesty is best" strengthens

**Challenge:**
- Experience contradicts belief → strength -10 to -25
- If strength drops below 20, belief may dissolve
- Example: Lie saves someone → "Honesty above all" weakens

**Fracture:**
- Traumatic contradiction → belief shatters instantly (-50 to -80)
- Example: Trusted person betrays → "People can be trusted" fractures
- Can leave void that new belief fills

**Formation:**
- Repeated experiences → new belief forms
- Starts weak (20-40), grows with reinforcement
- Example: Multiple betrayals → "Everyone betrays eventually" forms

**Conflict:**
- Holding contradicting beliefs → internal turmoil
- Effects: Stress +20, Confused state, Poor decisions
- Example: "Sex is sacred" (80) + "Sex is freedom" (60) = Conflict
- Resolution: One belief must weaken or fracture

## Physical Arousal Markers

**External Signs (Others can notice):**

## Orgasm Mechanics

- Can be blocked by: Anxiety >60, Pain >40, Distraction
- Affected by: Mood, stress, relationship comfort, setting

**Orgasm Intensity** (separate 0-100 scale per orgasm)

  - Emotional connection (if romantic trait high)
  - Setting (comfort, privacy)
  - Deprivation (longer since last = more intense)

**Post-Orgasm Effects:**
- Arousal drops to 0-10 immediately

  - During refractory: Arousal cannot rise above 20-30
  - Physical sensitivity high (may be uncomfortable to touch)

**Multiple Orgasms:**

## Arousal Interactions with Other Stats

**High Arousal (70+) Effects:**

- Judgment -15 (worse decisions)
- Risk-Taking +20 (more likely to do risky sexual things)
- Inhibitions -30 (modesty lower, lewdity higher temporarily)
- If Drunk + Aroused 70+: Risk-Taking +40, Judgment -35

**Blocked Arousal (High but cannot release):**
- If Arousal 80+ for >2 hours → Sexually Frustrated state 60+
- Effects: Irritability +20, Distraction +30, Desperation +40
- May lead to: Reckless behavior, lowered standards, seeking any outlet

**Relationship Context:**
- With trusted partner + Arousal 60+: Vulnerability +20, Openness +30
- With stranger + Arousal 60+: If low trust, Anxiety +20 (conflicts with desire)
- With person she's attracted to: Arousal rises faster (+1.5x multiplier)
